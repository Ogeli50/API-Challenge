# API-Challenge
This API challenge utilizes Python to create scripts that visualize the weather of over 500 cities at varying distances from the equator. The city Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API were used, along with problem-solving skills, to create a representative model of weather across cities.
The southern hemisphere exhibited a weak positive correlation between the max temperature and latitude, while the northern hemisphere showed a stronger positive relationship between the max temperature and latitude.
The northern hemisphere graph illustrates a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.89) between latitude and maximum temperature in the northern hemisphere.
